## Ghana records its highest air temperature in 5 yrs

The month of March and April has historically been the warmest months in Ghana.
These periods see a lot of outdoor sleeping especially for people in the rural communities who cannot afford
an aircondition or a fan.
Even though sleeping outside exposes them to mosquitoes and other insects, the heat presents a far more immidiate threat to the little comfort they can afford.
Global data from [ECMWF](https://registry.opendata.aws/ecmwf-era5/), shows an average air temperature of 36 degrees celsius for Ghana over the period of March.
On the 24th of March, at 6pm GMT, the air temperature at 2 meters for the country was:
