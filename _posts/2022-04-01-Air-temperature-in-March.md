## Ghana records its highest air temperature in 5 yrs

The month of March and April has historically been the warmest months in Ghana, with average temperatures ranging between 31°C (304.2 K) and 
26°C (299.2 K) according to [Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Ghana#cite_note-climate_monitor-5).

These periods see a lot of outdoor sleeping especially for people in the rural communities who cannot afford
an aircondition or a fan.  

Even though sleeping outside exposes them to mosquitoes and other insects, the heat presents a far more immidiate threat to the little comfort they can afford.

Over the years however,the air temperature has been steadily increasing leading to the country experiencing some heatwaves across some regions, especially the North.

The country's climate projections are in line with global assessments and tend to agree that temperatures will continue to rise per [UNFCCC](http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/ghanc3.pdf).
According to the [UNFCCC](http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/ghanc3.pdf), the Government of Ghana projects an increase in average annual temperature of up to 0.8 °C (274 K) by 2020 and 5.4 °C (278.55 K) by 2080, across all agro-ecological zones.

Global data from [ECMWF](https://registry.opendata.aws/ecmwf-era5/), shows the highest temperature recorded at Adenta, a populous municipality in the capital Accra, on the 24th of March 2022 was 32.8°C(306.0 K):

This is just a little above the maximum average temperature, spaning the last 18 years,for the month of March per data from [Weatherbase](https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=27456&units=).  
There are days that temperatures can go up to 35°C (308.2 K).

Whether this high temperatures are due to urbanization or global warming is still up for debate but what is clear is that Government and citizens have to do more beyond lip-service to tackle the issue.

Ghana is becoming increasingly hot and we all have a part to play.
