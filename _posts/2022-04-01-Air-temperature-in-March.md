## Ghana records its highest air temperature in 5 yrs

The month of March and April has historically been the warmest months in Ghana, with average temperatures ranging between 31 deg celsius and 26 deg celsius.
These periods see a lot of outdoor sleeping especially for people in the rural communities who cannot afford
an aircondition or a fan.
Even though sleeping outside exposes them to mosquitoes and other insects, the heat presents a far more immidiate threat to the little comfort they can afford.

Over the years however,the air temperature has been steadily increasing leading to the country experiencing some heatwaves across some regions, especially the North.

Global data from [ECMWF](https://registry.opendata.aws/ecmwf-era5/), shows an average air temperature of 36 degrees celsius for Ghana over the period of March, a hot month.

On the 24th of March, at 6pm GMT, the air temperature at 2 meters for the country was about 30 degrees celsius:
