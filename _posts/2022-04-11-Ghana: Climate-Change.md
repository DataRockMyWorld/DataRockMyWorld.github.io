## What is Climate Change?

Climate change is a global phenomenon of long-term changes in the Earth’s weather pattern.

The United Nations Framework Conversion on Climate Change [UNFCCC](https://unfccc.int)defines climate change as:
 
“*a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.*”

Human activities like industrialization, production, burning of fossil energy, the use of coal for heating, and deforestation drive the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 
These gases act like a blanket and trap the sun’s heat around the earth, thereby increasing atmospheric temperatures. 
This is known as [Global warming]( https://www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101)

Because the Earth is a system with interconnected processes, the effect of climate change goes beyond global warming. 
Water scarcity, drought, severe fires, drought, melting polar ice, storms, and declining biodiversity are all results of this phenomenon.

## Impact of Climate Change in Ghana

The impact of climate change in Ghana is well documented. 
The major drivers of economic growth in Ghana, i.e.  Agriculture, water, energy and mineral resources, are unfortunately, very sensitive to climate change.

Rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, drought, irregular rainfall patterns, and precipitation pose a threat to the country’s bionomics and economic growth.

Ghana’s [sea level]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise) has risen at a rate of 2.1 mm per year over the last 30 years. Projections indicate a sea-level rise to 34.5 cm by 2080.
The country’s 550 km coastline stretch has been largely affected to varying degrees by the rise in sea level.
In 2021, the people of Keta, a coastal town in the Volta Region of Ghana woke up to find almost half of their [community submerged]( https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211110-almost-4-000-people-displaced-by-tidal-surge-in-ghana) underwater and about 4000 people displaced.

Ghana has already lost about 37% of its [coastal land]( https://en.unesco.org/courier/2021-1/ghanas-coastline-swallowed-sea) to erosion and flooding between 2005 and 2017, with this percentage set to increase.

Agriculture, the largest employer in Ghana’s economic sector is the most affected by Climate change. Inconsistent rainfall patterns and extreme temperatures make predictions associated with farming very difficult because it is a rain-dependent venture. 
Investment in this sector is becoming increasingly risky and expensive because of uncertainty.
[The June 2010]( https://reliefweb.int/report/ghana/consolidated-report-flood-situation-southern-ghana-june-2010-floods) torrential rains floods demonstrated how climate change can reverse developmental investments and damage infrastructure, with more than a 1,000 homes destroyed, millions of dollars in property losses and the collapse of a bridge linking Ghana and neighboring Togo, cutting off travel between the two West African countries.
Temperatures in Ghana have risen by approximately [1°C since the 1960s]( https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/2021-06/15857-WB_Ghana%20Country%20Profile-WEB.pdf), an average increase of 0.216 °C per decade.
The Northern and inland areas of the country are most affected by the heatwave.
By mid-century, the country is expected to experience an 18 – 59% increase in the number of “hot” days. 
These high temperatures have implications for human and animal health, water resources and biodiversity.

Drought and reduced rainfall threaten an already erratic and insufficient power supply, which is dominantly hydro sourced.

Data from the [Emergency Event Database]( http://emdat.be/emdat_db/): EM-Dat database, shows the country has endured various natural hazards, including floods, landslides, epidemic diseases, and storms.

## Climate change initiatives in Ghana

“Ghana acknowledges the importance and effects of Climate Change, and the urgent need to combat it, and we acknowledge equally the importance of protecting our development”

These were the words of the president of Ghana speaking at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP 26, in Glasgow in 2021.
For a very long time, Climate Change and conversations around it have taken a secondary role in National development issues in Ghana. 
Even in the midst of overwhelming evidence of the impact of this existential threat, the Governments response has most often been ad-hoc rather than proactive and strategic.

However, in the last two decades, there have been positive signs of the Government actually handling the problem beyond lip service.

Since 2007, Government has undertaken several [initiatives related to adaptation to Climate Change](https://cdkn.org/sites/default/files/files/Ghana-initiatives-mapping-climate-change-May2011.pdf).

In 2012, the [National Climate Change Policy]( https://www.un-page.org/files/public/ghanaclimatechangepolicy.pdf) was published. 
It was framed as Ghana’s flagship policy to sustainably respond to climate change. The policy touched on adaptative strategies like governance and coordination, science, technology and innovation, education, and monitoring as areas of top priority for the government.
The vision was to:

“Ensure a climate-resilient and climate-compatible economy while achieving sustainable development through equitable low-carbon economic growth for Ghana”


The adoption of policies such as [National Forest Plantation Development Program] was aimed at restoring the country’s lost forest through deforestation and urbanization. 
In June 2021, a nationwide campaign through the [Green Ghana project] saw over seven million trees planted with plans to plant a further 20 million next year.
The objective of this policy is to restore the forests and woodlands of the country. These afforestation and restoration policies increase the biological sinks for and stores for carbon, a natural mitigation of GHGs through the sequestration of gases.

According to the [USAID]( https://www.climatelinks.org/sites/default/files/asset/document/GHG%20Emissions%20Factsheet%20Ghana_6-17-16_edited_rev08-18-2016.pdf), 53% of Ghana’s total emissions is driven by changes in forest land. 
Ghana through the implementation of the Ghana Cocoa Forest [REDD+]( https://www.fao.org/faolex/results/details/en/c/LEX-FAOC178876/)  Readiness Program aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions over the next twenty years by some ten million tonnes in the cocoa-forest landscape.
This is the world's first commodity-based emission reductions program. Using a climate-smart cocoa production strategy, the program aims to significantly reduce emissions driven by deforestation and forest degradation, while improving farmers' livelihoods through significant yield increases and other benefit-sharing arrangements.


Ghana’s [Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC)]( https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/submissions/indc/Submission%20Pages/submissions.aspx) identifies emission reduction actions to be undertaken between 2020 and 2030 in the energy, transportation, agriculture, forestry and land use, waste, and industry sectors.

Ghana aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2030 through actions including a 20% improvement in the energy efficiency of industrial facilities, replacement of light crude oil with natural gas in electricity generation plants, and the reforestation and afforestation of 10,000 hectares of degraded lands annually. 
The [INDC]( https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/submissions/indc/Submission%20Pages/submissions.aspx) believes this target could be strengthened to 45% with international support by increasing renewable energy penetration, increasing the use of efficient domestic appliances, expanding mass transportation in cities, and encouraging large-scale energy conservation.

The government through the [National Climate Chane Adaptation Strategy](https://www.adaptation-undp.org/sites/default/files/downloads/ghana_national_climate_change_adaptation_strategy_nccas.pdf) intends to protect water resources by building capacity in water resource management, increasing water availability and accessibility for domestic, industrial and agricultural production.

## What More Can be done?

The majority of these adaptation policies remain exactly that, policies. Implementation remains a distant dream.

This is due in part to a lack of financial capacity to implement some of these policies.
Finances promised to developing countries via the [Paris Climate Accord]( https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement) are yet to be received.

However, beyond the availability of funds to implement policies on the National scale, I believe government can start off on the district scale. District assemblies can be made to apportion some of their internally generated funds toward fighting climate change. This can be done through awareness town hall meetings, periodical climate “theme” events and monitoring effective local waste disposal.
 
I also believe an important aspect of greenhouse gas emission that has been ignored is the proper disposal of plastic waste. Ghana generates about [1.1 million tons](https://globalplasticaction.org/countries/ghana/) of plastic waste per year. Most of this waste is disposed of by burning. This poses a climate risk, as well as a health risk, because of the presence of greenhouse gases and carcinogens in plastics.

Government and Waste management companies have made some efforts to encourage people to submit plastic wastes for recycling but that is not enough.
I believe an aggressive awareness campaign by the Ghana Health Service about the health implications of this exercise will bring public awareness of this practice to the fore.
People can further be encouraged to turn in a specified volume of plastic waste for rewards (cash or kind).
In the long term, Government should study the option of putting a ban on the use of plastics.

Another part is the lack of representation of the local government in policy-making. 
Within my local community (Adenta), there is a major lack of awareness of Climate change and its impact even among community leaders.

I believe Government representatives have to open dialogues with community leaders about climate change, its impact on their activities, and the importance of Governments adaptation policies.
The fight against climate change must have a holistic approach (Involving all interested parties). It will be futile for government to draw up policies without involving the local stakeholders. 

Government must Embrace Climate Data Analysis in their Policies.

Data Science helps us convert scientific data, historical and real-time, into meaningful insights.

The government through the Meteorological Agency and other climate Monitoring agencies generates huge volumes of data daily.
We can use this data, both historical and real-time to tackle climate-related issues, like tracking harmful emissions and tracking rainfall patterns, analyzing carbon footprints, promoting climate awareness and developing sustainable products that have minimal impact on the climate.

Having access to this data helps us mitigate the effect of changes in the weather. Farmers and other stakeholders can make informed decisions based on this data.


There are several proprietary software’s to help with the analysis of climate data but they can be very expensive.

## Galaxy Climate to the Rescue?

This is where [Galaxy Climate]( https://galaxyproject.org/) comes in. 

Access to free, open-source data analysis software like Galaxy Climate can support local government in the fight against climate change.

Galaxy is a web-based data analysis platform used by a global community of researchers, scientists and software to perform data-intensive research.

It is well resourced with documentation, events, codes, tutorials, presentations and data on climate at no cost to the user.

With the help of Galaxy Climate, Government can build local capacity in climate data generation, management and analysis. 
Climate education is an important tool in the fight against climate change and Galaxy Climate can serve as an instrument through which climate education is made more accessible to the good people of Ghana.

The use of this tool also enables collaboration between local government and the central government through the sharing/publishing of history feature in Galaxy.

Through features like Galaxy’s workflow, we can develop standard methods of analysing certain variables, which can be duplicated across board. 

Through Galaxy, information can be made available to scientific, technical and managerial personnel for climate mitigation.

Galaxy’s customized tools are dedicated to Climate data analysis which can be combined with any other Galaxy Tools (text manipulation, imaging, machine learning, etc.) to create automated workflows to support climate impact studies and local climate actions.

The availability of reliable African climate data information on Galaxy, similar to [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) can go a long way in making the platform more friendly to scientists or users from my region. 

The galaxy community can also help Ghana build capacity by training local officials on the use of the platform through online workshops.

A beautiful feature I believe can make the Galaxy User Interface more user-friendly is to introduce a highlight stating the function whenever you hover over a tool in the tool section. 

A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. 

I believe Data and an open-source platform like galaxy climate gives us the opportunity to educate, generate, manage, manipulate and analyze climate data to help mitigate the impact of weather and climate change on a regional scale.
