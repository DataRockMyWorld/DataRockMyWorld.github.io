## What is Climate Change?

Climate change is a global phenomenon of long-term changes in the Earth’s weather pattern.
The [United Nations Framework Conversion on Climate Change NFCCC](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/introduction-climate-action) defines climate change as:
 
“*a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity 
that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to 
natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.*”

Human activities like industrialization, production, burning, and use of fossil energy, the use of coal for heating, and deforestation drive the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases act like a blanket and trap the sun’s heat around the earth, thereby increasing atmospheric temperatures. This is known as [Global warming]( https://www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101)

Because the Earth is a system with interconnected processes, the effect of climate change goes beyond global warming. Water scarcity, drought, severe fires, drought, melting polar ice, storms, and declining biodiversity are all results of this phenomenon.

Impact of Climate Change in Ghana

The impact of climate change in Ghana is well documented. 
Rising sea level, increasing temperatures, drought, irregular rainfall patterns and precipitation pose a threat to the country’s bionomics and economic growth.

The most affected sectors in Ghana include the economic, social, and infrastructural groups
 
Available data shows Ghana’s [sea level]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise) has risen at a rate of 2.1 mm per year over the last 30 years. Projections at this rate indicate a sea-level rise of 5.8 cm, 16.5 cm, and 34.5 cm by 2020, 2050 and 2080.
The country’s 550 km coastline stretch has been largely affected to varying degrees by the rise in sea level.
In 2021, the people of Keta, a coastal town in the Volta Region of Ghana woke up to find almost half of their [community submerged]( https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211110-almost-4-000-people-displaced-by-tidal-surge-in-ghana) underwater and about 4000 people displaced.
In total, Ghana has lost about 37% of its [coastal land]( https://en.unesco.org/courier/2021-1/ghanas-coastline-swallowed-sea) to erosion and flooding between 2005 and 2017, with this percentage set to increase.

Agriculture, the largest employer in Ghana’s economic sector is the most affected by Climate change. Inconsistent rainfall patterns and extreme temperatures make predictions associated with farming very difficult because it is a rain-dependent venture. Investment in this sector is becoming increasingly risky and expensive because of uncertainty.
[The June 2010]( https://reliefweb.int/report/ghana/consolidated-report-flood-situation-southern-ghana-june-2010-floods) floods demonstrated how climate change can reverse developmental investments and damage infrastructure, with more than a 1,000 homes destroyed, millions of dollars in property losses and the collapse of a bridge linking Ghana and neighboring Togo, cutting off travel between the two West African countries. 
Drought and reduced rainfall threaten an already erratic and insufficient power supply, [extreme heat conditions] because of increasing temperatures, which will result in significant implications for human and animal health, agriculture, water resources, and ecosystems.
Data from the Emergency Event Database: EM-Dat database, shows the country has endured various natural hazards, including floods, landslides, epidemic diseases, and storms.



## Local Climate change initiatives in Ghana

“*Ghana acknowledges the importance and effects of Climate Change, and the urgent need to combat it, 
and we acknowledge equally the importance of protecting our development*”

These were the words of the president of Ghana speaking at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP 26, in Glasgow in 2021.
For a very long time, Climate Change and conversations around it have taken a secondary role in National development issues in Ghana. 
Even in the midst of overwhelming evidence of the impact of this existential threat, the Governments response has most often been ad-hoc rather than proactive and strategic.
However, in the last two decades, there have been positive signs of the Government actually handling the problem beyond lip service.

Since 2007, Government has undertaken several [initiatives related to adaptation to Climate Change](https://cdkn.org/sites/default/files/files/Ghana-initiatives-mapping-climate-change-May2011.pdf).

In 2012, the [National Climate Change Policy]( https://www.un-page.org/files/public/ghanaclimatechangepolicy.pdf) was published. It was framed as Ghana’s flagship policy to sustainably respond to climate change. The policy touched on adaptative strategies like governance and coordination, science, technology and innovation, education, and monitoring as areas of top priority for the government.

“Ensure a climate-resilient and climate-compatible economy while achieving sustainable development through equitable low-carbon economic growth for Ghana”


The adoption of policies such as [National Forest Plantation Development Program] was aimed at restoring the country’s lost forest through deforestation and urbanization. 
In June 2021, a nationwide campaign through the [Green Ghana project] saw over seven million trees planted with plans to plant a further 20 million next year.
The objective of this policy is to restore the forests and woodlands of the country. These afforestation and restoration policies increase the biological sinks for and stores for carbon, a natural mitigation of GHGs through the sequestration of gases.

According to the [USAID]( https://www.climatelinks.org/sites/default/files/asset/document/GHG%20Emissions%20Factsheet%20Ghana_6-17-16_edited_rev08-18-2016.pdf), 53% of Ghana’s total emissions is driven by changes in forest land. 
Ghana through the implementation of the Ghana Cocoa Forest [REDD+]( https://www.fao.org/faolex/results/details/en/c/LEX-FAOC178876/)  Readiness Program aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions over the next twenty years by some ten million tonnes in the cocoa-forest landscape.
This is the world's first commodity-based emission reductions program. Using a climate-smart cocoa production strategy, the program aims to significantly reduce emissions driven by deforestation and forest degradation, while improving farmers' livelihoods through significant yield increases and other benefit-sharing arrangements.


 
Ghana’s [Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC)]( https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/submissions/indc/Submission%20Pages/submissions.aspx) identifies emission reduction actions to be undertaken between 2020 and 2030 in the energy, transportation, agriculture, forestry and land use, waste, and industry sectors.

Ghana aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2030 through actions including a 20% improvement in the energy efficiency of industrial facilities, replacement of light crude oil with natural gas in electricity generation plants, and the reforestation and afforestation of 10,000 hectares of degraded lands annually. The [INDC]() believes this target could be strengthened to 45% with international support by increasing renewable energy penetration, increasing the use of efficient domestic appliances, expanding mass transportation in cities, and encouraging large-scale energy conservation.

The government through the [National Climate Chane Adaptation Strategy](https://www.adaptation-undp.org/sites/default/files/downloads/ghana_national_climate_change_adaptation_strategy_nccas.pdf) intends to protect water resources by building capacity in water resource management, increasing water availability and accessibility for domestic, industrial and agricultural production.

## What More Can be done?

For a large part, a lot of these policies remain exactly that, policies. Implementation remains a distant dream.
This is due in part to a lack of financial capacity to implement some of these policies.
Finances promised to developing countries via the [Paris Climate Agreement]( https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement) are yet to be received.

Another part is the lack of representation of local government in policy-making. Within local communities, there is a lack of awareness of Climate change and its impact.
Government representatives have to open dialogues with community leaders about climate change and its impact on their activities.  

There are huge gaps when it comes to district-level implementation and monitoring of these climate change adaptation policies.

There needs to be a training of personnel of the district assemblies on climate tracking and monitoring tools. 

This is where [Galaxy]( https://galaxyproject.org/) comes in. Access to an open-source data analysis software like Galaxy Climate can help support these Government initiatives.

Galaxy Climate to the Rescue?

Galaxy is a web-based scientific analysis platform used by a global community of researchers, scientists and software to perform data-intensive research.

Government can leverage the numerous climate resources such as documentation, events, codes, tutorials, presentations and data available in Galaxy at no cost.

The use of this tool also encourages collaboration between local government and the central government through the sharing/publishing of history feature in Galaxy.

With the help of Galaxy Climate, Government can build local capacity in climate data generation, management and analysis. Climate education is an important tool in the fight against climate change and Galaxy Climate can serve as an instrument through which climate education is made more accessible to the good people of Ghana.

Through Galaxy, information can be made available to scientific, technical and managerial personnel for climate mitigation.

Galaxy’s customized tools are dedicated to Climate data analysis which can be combined with any other Galaxy Tools (text manipulation, imaging, machine learning, etc.) to create automated workflows to support climate impact studies and local climate actions.
